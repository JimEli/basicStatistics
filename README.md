## Basic C++ Statistical Functions

The statistical functions herein are those coveredin a basic course of statistics.

Note: work in progress. These functions are sourced from various locations around the web. Code is completely unpolished, without comments or attributions (yet).
 
### Basic statistical functions performed on a vector of data:
<ol>
  <li>mean</li>
  <li>median</li>
  <li>mode</li>
  <li>variance</li>
  <li>standard deviation</li>
  <li>z-score</li>
</ol>


### The following functions act basically like the identical versions found in R:
<ol>
  <li>pnorm, qnorm, dnorm</li>
  <li>pbinom, qbinom, dbinom</li>
  <li>ppois, qpois, dpois</li>
  <li>pt, qt, dt</li>
  <li>pchisq, qchisq, dchisq</li>
</ol>
